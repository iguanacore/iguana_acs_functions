# Iguana's Overhaul, fixes
A mod, consisting of functional changes for Amazing Cultivation Simulator, not just fixes.

## Install instructions

Download the latest release, extract the iguana_acs_functions into the Mods folder. If the release is behind the Main version and you want to update to the preview version, download the repository directly, and extract the contents of the archive into the iguana_acs_functions folder, located in the Mods folder.
(Due to the inclusion of Harmony Patches, it's best to stick with the Release.)

Activate the Mod in Mod Manager, make sure to load it after any of the prerequisite Mods.

For ensuring that Patches are loaded, restart the game.

## Compatibility with other mods
